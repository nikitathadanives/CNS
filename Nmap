#Scan port 80 on the target system
nmap –p 80 192.168.0.1

#OS finger printing Nmap can detect the operating system running on the target
nmap -O <target-ip>

#Ping Scan To perform a ping scan (just to check which hosts are up):
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

#Scan ports 1 through 200 on the target system
nmap –p 1-200 192.168.0.1

#Scan (Fast) the most common ports
nmap –F 192.168.0.1

#To scan all ports (1 – 65535)
nmap –p– 192.168.0.1

#To scan using TCP connect (it takes longer, but is more likely to connect):
nmap –sT 192.168.0.1

#To instruct Nmap to scan UDP ports instead of TCP ports (the –p switch specifies ports 80, 130, and 255 in this example):
nmap –sU 192.168.0.1

#The nmap utility can be used to detect the operating system of a particular target:
nmap –A 192.168.0.1
